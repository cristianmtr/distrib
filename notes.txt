redesign packet structure in requester.py to allow for variable length input
first: try with old map / reduce combos

data = "WORK,{},{},{},{}{}{}".format(lmap,lmapinput,lreduce,maptext,mapinput,reducetext)

I might just need to write another function to be distributed to the server: a task-splitter

it should work like:
    subprocess.check_output(["python","ditributor.py",arg_len(WORKERS)])
    
    return ["arg_for_1", "arg_for_2"]
