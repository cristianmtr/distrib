USE CASE FOR THE TIME BEING

"python server.py"

"python worker.py" (can be started as many times as you want. it will just add more workers to the pool)

"python requester.py <arguments>" (read the help text for more info on the argumnets to be passed)

Tested on Windows and Linux. 

NOTE: IPs are hardcoded to "localhost". If you want to run on different machines (VMs, for example) you will need to edit this.
