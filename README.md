Project for learning distributed systems architecture

USE CASE FOR THE TIME BEING

"python server.py"
"python client.py" - this can be run as many times as you want to; it will just add more workers to the hive;
"python test.py" - this is the request initiator script

Tested on Windows. 

NOTE: IPs are hardcoded to "localhost". If you want to run on different machines (VMs, for example) you will need to edit this.
