Project for learning distributed systems architecture

USE CASE FOR THE TIME BEING

"python server.py"

"python client.py" - this can be run as many times as you want to; it will just add more workers to the hive;

"python requester.py" - this is the request initiator script. See comments inside for instructions for cl-arguments

Tested on Windows and Linux. 

NOTE: IPs are hardcoded to "localhost". If you want to run on different machines (VMs, for example) you will need to edit this.
